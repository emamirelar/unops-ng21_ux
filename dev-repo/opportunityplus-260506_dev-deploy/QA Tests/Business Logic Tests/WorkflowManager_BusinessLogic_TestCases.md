## Feature Overview

WorkflowManager handles Opportunity workflow stage transitions and business rules. Key functionality: stage transition validation (IDENTIFY & PROFILE → GO/NO GO/CANCELLED, NO GO/CANCELLED → I&P), DoA Level 2/3 approver resolution (PNO-1197), 21 mandatory field validation for GO transition, self-approval prevention, rejection → NO GO, OM recall rules, statement regeneration on submit, post-decision immutability, executive assignment, email CC recipients, notification creation on stage change, and confirmation acknowledgment.

## §1 Positive Tests (Happy Path) — 30 tests

> **Minimum:** 30-50 tests | **Focus:** Valid stage transitions, successful workflow operations

### Detailed Test Cases (P0)

#### POS-001: I&P → GO Transition with All 21 Requirements Met

**Priority:** P0  
**Precondition:** Opportunity in IDENTIFY & PROFILE with all 21 mandatory fields populated. User has submit permission. DoA2 holder exists for ResponsibleOrgUnit.

**Steps:**
1. Call `ChangeStageAsync` with fromStage=IDENTIFY & PROFILE, toStage=GO
2. Verify transition succeeds

**Expected Result:**
- Stage changes to GO
- Opportunity becomes read-only (terminal state)
- Notification created for approver
- Audit trail records transition

---

#### POS-002: I&P → NO GO Transition

**Priority:** P0  
**Precondition:** Opportunity in IDENTIFY & PROFILE. User has submit permission. Comment provided.

**Steps:**
1. Call `ChangeStageAsync` with fromStage=IDENTIFY & PROFILE, toStage=NO GO
2. Provide mandatory comment

**Expected Result:**
- Stage changes to NO GO
- Opportunity becomes read-only
- Rejection path (not back to I&P)
- Notification created

---

#### POS-003: I&P → CANCELLED (OM Only)

**Priority:** P0  
**Precondition:** Opportunity in IDENTIFY & PROFILE. User is Opportunity Manager. Mandatory comment provided.

**Steps:**
1. Call `ChangeStageAsync` with fromStage=IDENTIFY & PROFILE, toStage=CANCELLED
2. Provide mandatory comment

**Expected Result:**
- Stage changes to CANCELLED
- Opportunity becomes read-only
- OM-only action enforced

---

#### POS-004: NO GO → I&P Reopen

**Priority:** P0  
**Precondition:** Opportunity in NO GO. User is OM. Optional comment.

**Steps:**
1. Call `ChangeStageAsync` with fromStage=NO GO, toStage=IDENTIFY & PROFILE
2. Reopen action

**Expected Result:**
- Stage changes to IDENTIFY & PROFILE
- Opportunity editable again
- No approval required

---

#### POS-005: CANCELLED → I&P Reopen

**Priority:** P0  
**Precondition:** Opportunity in CANCELLED. User is OM. Mandatory comment provided.

**Steps:**
1. Call `ChangeStageAsync` with fromStage=CANCELLED, toStage=IDENTIFY & PROFILE
2. Provide mandatory comment

**Expected Result:**
- Stage changes to IDENTIFY & PROFILE
- Opportunity editable again
- Mandatory comment enforced
