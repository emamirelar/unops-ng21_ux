## Executable Tests (4 of 102)

The following tests CAN be executed against the current implementation:

### 1. TC-GO-VAL-001 (Partial)
**Title:** All 18+ Required Fields Validated  
**Executable Scope:** Only 4 fields (Name, Description, ResponsibleOrgUnitId, InitiativeBudgetUSD)  
**Expected:** Validation for 4 fields works  
**Status:** 🟡 Partial - Only 20% of fields tested

### 2. TC-GO-VAL-010
**Title:** Text Fields Required  
**Executable Scope:** Name and Description only  
**Status:** 🟡 Partial

### 3. TC-GO-VIEW-002 (Partial)
**Title:** Opportunity Read-Only in Workflow  
**Executable Scope:** Basic workflow locking may work  
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs verification

### 4. TC-GO-VIS-002 (Partial)
**Title:** Workflow Status Clearly Visible  
**Executable Scope:** Basic workflow status indicator  
**Status:** ⚠️ Needs verification

## Scaffolded C# Tests Status

**File:** `QA Tests/Opportunity Tests/Archive/Scaffolded/C# Tests/BusinessLogic/GoNoGoDecisionTests.cs`

**Status:** ❌ NOT EXECUTABLE

**Reason:** The tests reference non-existent classes:
- `GoNoGoDecisionLogic` - Does not exist
- `INotificationService` - Different interface signature
- `GoNoGoProcesses` - DbSet does not exist
- `OpportunityDecisions` - DbSet does not exist
- `DecisionConditions` - DbSet does not exist
- `DueDiligenceChecks` - DbSet does not exist

These are **scaffolded placeholder tests** that document expected behavior but cannot run until the business logic layer is implemented.

---

## Recommendations

### For Development Team

1. **Implement PRD requirements** - The test cases document exact expected behavior
2. **Start with OpportunityStageRequirements** - Add the 16+ missing field validations
3. **Implement DoA2 lookup** - Query EntityUserRole with Code="DoA2_Engagement_Acceptance"
4. **Create email templates** - Use exact wording from PRD
5. **Add CANCELLED stage** - Update state machine seeders

### For QA Team

1. **Test cases serve as acceptance criteria** - Share with developers
2. **Create Playwright tests** - Once backend is implemented
3. **Update this report** - Track implementation progress
4. **Re-execute blocked tests** - As features become available

---

## Test Execution Commands (When Ready)

### Run C# Tests (Once Implemented)
```bash
cd "QA Tests/C# Tests"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~GoNoGoDecision" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Run Playwright Tests (Once Created)
```bash
cd "QA Tests/Playwright Tests"
npx playwright test go-decision.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

---

## Next Steps

| Action | Owner | Priority | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| Log DEF-NEW-001 to Defect List for Developers | QA | P0 | ✅ Pending |
| Share test cases with Dev team as requirements | QA | P0 | ⬜ TODO |
| Track implementation progress | QA | P1 | ⬜ TODO |
| Create Playwright automated tests | QA | P1 | ⬜ Waiting for backend |
| Update this report weekly | QA | P2 | ⬜ TODO |

## Actual Test Execution Results (February 2, 2026)

### .NET Workflow Tests Execution

**Command:** `dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Workflow"`

| Metric | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Total Tests | 76 |
| Passed | 72 (94.7%) |
| Failed | 4 (5.3%) |
| Duration | 22.7 seconds |

**Failed Tests (4):**
All failures due to **QA-009** (Z.EntityFramework.Extensions InMemory DB issue):
1. `UpdateOpportunity_ChangeWorkflowStage_Success` - GetRelationalModel error
2. `OpportunityWorkflow_ProgressThroughAllStages_Success` - GetRelationalModel error
3. `OpportunityWorkflowProgression_UpdatesStages_Success` - GetRelationalModel error
4. *(1 additional workflow test)* - Same root cause

**Root Cause:** Z.EntityFramework.Extensions `BulkUpdate` requires relational database, not InMemory provider.

### PRD Test Cases Status

| Category | Created | Executable | Result |
|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Go Decision PRD Tests | 102 | 4 partial | ⚠️ Blocked by DEF-008 |
| .NET Workflow Tests | 76 | 72 | ✅ 94.7% passed |
| Scaffolded GoNoGoDecisionTests | 30+ | 0 | ❌ References non-existent classes |

### Summary

- **Test cases created today:** 102 (GoNoGoDecision_PRD_TestCases.md)
- **Can be executed now:** 4 partial tests (~4%)
- **Blocked by implementation:** 98 tests (96%)
- **Related defects logged:**
  - DEF-008: Go Decision Feature Incomplete (Developer action required)
  - QA-016: Go Decision PRD Tests Blocked (QA tracking)
