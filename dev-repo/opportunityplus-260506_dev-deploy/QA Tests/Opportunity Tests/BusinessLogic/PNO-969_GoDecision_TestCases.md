## Key Design Decisions

| Item | Decision | Source |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Initial status** | **Draft** (not Active) | Issam workflow map (2026-02-10) |
| **Collaborator** | **Assignment, not a role** — users assigned as `OpportunityCollaborator` can edit all opportunity fields but cannot perform workflow stage transitions (Submit, Cancel, Reopen, Approve, Reject). Only OM and Partnership Lead (DoA2) can perform workflow actions. | Codebase (`OpportunityCollaborator` entity, `StateMachineStageChangeRoleSeeder`) |
| **Cancel = Closed** | Cancel moves stage to CANCELLED, status to Closed | Fouad/Roz (2026-01-23) |
| **Rejection = NO GO** | Rejection moves stage to NO GO (not back to I&P) | PRD and AC Section 5 |
| **DoA2 = Decision Maker** | Lowest level DoA starting at Level 2 for responsible org unit | AC Section 5 |
| **Cancel requires reason** | Free text justification required | AC Section 5 |
| **OM role transfer** | OM→Collaborator when new OM assigned | AC Section 1 (Bug: PNO-1193) |

## Stage/Status Transition Matrix

| # | Role | Current Stage | Current Status | Action | Target Stage | Target Status |
|---|------|---------------|----------------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | OM | Identify & Profile | Draft | Submit for Go | GO | Active |

## Known Issues & Blockers

| JIRA ID | Issue | Impact on Testing |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| PNO-1193 | OM role transfer not working (DEF-010) | POS-029 blocked |
| PNO-1171 | Reject action appears twice in history (DEF-011) | FUN-040 affected |
| — | Collaborator is an assignment, not a system role | NEG-001 through NEG-010 verify workflow action denial for assigned collaborators (collaborators can edit content but cannot perform stage transitions) |
| — | Initial status "Draft" vs AC saying "Active" | Pending requirements from Roz/Issam |
| — | Inactive OM visibility requires DB deactivation | FUN-033 blocked |
| — | Additional Remarks missing character count | BND-033 — refinement ticket needed |

## §2 Negative Tests (Failure Scenarios)

> **Count: 90** | **Minimum: 3×30=90** | ✅ COMPLIANT

### 2.1 Collaborator Workflow Action Denial (10 tests)

> **Note:** "Collaborator" refers to a user assigned as an `OpportunityCollaborator` on the opportunity (part of the Opportunity Development Team). Collaborators **can edit all content fields** but **cannot perform workflow stage transitions** — those are restricted to the Opportunity Manager (OM) and Partnership Lead (DoA2) per the `StateMachineStageChangeRoleSeeder`. The collaborator feature is implemented via the `OpportunityCollaborators` table and Team section UI.

| NEG-001 | Submit for Go | Assigned Collaborator | I&P/Draft | Access Denied — Submit button not visible or disabled (only OM can submit) | P0 |
| NEG-002 | Reject workflow | Assigned Collaborator | I&P/Draft | Access Denied — only DoA2 can reject | P0 |
| NEG-003 | Cancel opportunity | Assigned Collaborator | I&P/Draft | Access Denied — Cancel action not available (only OM can cancel) | P0 |
| NEG-004 | Reopen from Cancelled | Assigned Collaborator | CANCELLED/Closed | Access Denied — only OM can reopen | P0 |

| NEG-009 | Edit during workflow | Assigned Collaborator | GO/Active | All fields read-only (same as OM — entire record locked during workflow) | P1 |
| NEG-010 | View DoA pathway | Assigned Collaborator | GO/Active | Can view but not modify DoA pathway | P1 |
