Convert each item into the exact JSON structure shown below. Only include non-empty fields.

**Required fields:** type, date, subject
**Validation rules:**
- Map contact names to contactIds (keep as text if name, number if ID)
- Map partner names to partnerIds (keep as text if name, number if ID)
- Map user names to userIds (keep as text if name, number if ID)
- Map emailAddresses to emailAddresses
- Map location / country you find to location
- Format date as ISO 8601 timestamp (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
- Default status to "Active"
- Include dependents for all ID fields that are text names
- Based on the context of the message, auto-detect the date.
- Put one of the contactIds into contactId
- Only include "id" field in JSON output if ID column is present in source data
- Focus on essential fields only: type, date, subject, description, contactId, status, emailAddresses
- Extract email addresses from the interaction content and populate emailAddresses as an array of strings

**Interaction types:** Email,Chat,Call,VirtualMeeting,InPersonMeeting,Other (USE THE EXACT WORD WITHOUT SPACES)

**HEADER MAPPING:**
"ID"/"Interaction ID" → id (number, only if present)
"Type" → type
"Date" → date (default to today''s date if nothing is present)
"Subject" → subject
"Description" → description
"Contact" → contactIds (could be number or contact names)

"Status" → status
"Location" -> location
EmailAddresses -> EmailAddresses
User ID (any user info) -> userIds

- Set partnerId as string name, include "partnerId" in dependents for ID resolution
- Set selectedOrgUnitId as string name (optional field). CRITICAL: Always check for org unit data in columns like "Contact Organization Unit Description", "Contact Organization Unit", "Contact Org Unit", "Org Unit", "UNOPS Org Unit" - extract the org unit name/value even if the column name varies slightly
- Omit null/empty fields from JSON to keep it compact (including selectedOrgUnitId if not present in the data)
- Compute name field as concatenation of salutation + firstName + lastName
- Only include "id" field in JSON output if ID column is present in source data
- Focus on essential fields only: name components, title, email, phone, partnerId, department, selectedOrgUnitId
- CRITICAL FOR DEPENDENTS: Always return dependents as ["partnerId", "selectedOrgUnitId"] regardless of whether selectedOrgUnitId has a value in the current record. The dependents array structure must be consistent across all records. Only omit selectedOrgUnitId from the JSON object itself if it has no value, but always include "selectedOrgUnitId" in the dependents array.

**RESPONSE FORMAT:**
{"Message":"Contact data processed successfully.","Category":"Contact","ResponseType":"Action","records":[...]}

Return compact single-line JSON. If more input needed, set ResponseType to "Information". 

**CRITICAL - DEPENDENTS ARRAY RULES:**
- The "dependents" property is used to indicate which properties in the JSON are IDs and require mapping
- ALWAYS return dependents as ["partnerId", "selectedOrgUnitId"] for EVERY record, regardless of whether selectedOrgUnitId has a value
- DO NOT modify the dependents array structure - it must be consistent across all records
- DO NOT conditionally include/exclude "selectedOrgUnitId" from the dependents array based on data presence
- The dependents array structure is fixed: ["partnerId", "selectedOrgUnitId"]
- Only omit the selectedOrgUnitId FIELD from the JSON object itself if it has no value, but the dependents array must always include both "partnerId" and "selectedOrgUnitId"

**CRITICAL - SELECTEDORGUNITID EXTRACTION:**
- Always check for org unit information in the data, even if column names vary
- Look for columns containing: "Contact Organization Unit", "Contact Org Unit", "Org Unit", "UNOPS Org Unit", "Contact Organization Unit Description"
- Extract the org unit value even if the column header is slightly different
- Include selectedOrgUnitId in the JSON object if any org unit information is found

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. **READ THE DOCUMENT THOROUGHLY**: Carefully read all text, tables, and structured content in the provided document
2. **EXTRACT ACTUAL DATA**: Pull out real project names, descriptions, budget figures, partner names, country names, SDG references, and all other relevant information that appears in the document
3. **FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITY-SPECIFIC INFORMATION**: Extract information about the specific opportunity/project described in the document, not generic document metadata
4. **DOCUMENT TYPE**: This is a **{documentType}** - analyze it accordingly to find opportunity-related information
5. **CONTEXT AWARE**: Use the provided opportunity context (name and description) to guide your extraction and ensure relevance
6. **CROSS-CUTTING — READ EVERYTHING FIRST**: Before you set any **crossCuttingConcern*** fields, re-read the **entire** document—**name**, **title**, **description**, strategic sections, tables, footnotes, and any narrative or appendix. Cross-cutting signals may appear **only** in the main description, body text, or a non-labeled paragraph—not solely in a dedicated "cross-cutting" or "WHY" heading. **Only after** you have reviewed this full content should you derive answers for cross-cutting concerns; do not infer from a single sentence or section in isolation.

**YOUR GOAL**: Extract the details of the **OPPORTUNITY/PROJECT/INITIATIVE** described in this document that are relevant to updating or enhancing the current opportunity information.

**CRITICAL**: All property names MUST be in camelCase format (e.g., "name", "description", "fundingPartners", "clientPartners").

## OpportunityModel Structure - Extractable Fields Only

**IMPORTANT**: Only extract and return the following fields. Do NOT include status, workflow stage, or system-generated fields.

### Basic Information (camelCase)
- **name** (string, max 120 characters): The ACTUAL PROJECT/OPPORTUNITY TITLE from the document (e.g., "Sustainable Water Infrastructure Development", "Education Reform Program"). MUST NOT exceed 120 characters.
- **description** (string): Detailed description of the OPPORTUNITY/PROJECT itself - what the project does, its scope, objectives, and activities

### Organizational & Initiative Type (camelCase)
- **responsibleOrgUnitId** (int?): ID of the responsible organizational unit (use null if extracting text name)
- **responsibleOrgUnitName** (string?): Name of the responsible organizational unit (e.g., "Global Infrastructure Unit", "East Africa Regional Office")
- **proposedInitiativeTypeId** (string|int?): **Put the initiative type NAME as text here** (same pattern as other dependents - the "Id" suffix maps to the table name for resolution). Use **exactly one** of: "Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio". Map document content: "Project" = single initiative with defined scope; "Programme" = collection of related projects; "Portfolio" = collection of programmes and projects. Map "Program" → "Programme"; map "Initiative", "Activity" → "Project". If unclear, use "Project". **MUST add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents array** - the backend resolves the text to the ID via ProposedInitiativeTypes table (Id→Types, pluralized).

### Financial & Timeline (camelCase)
- **initiativeBudgetUSD** (decimal?): Total proposed budget in USD when NO PARTNER-SPECIFIC breakdown is available. Use this ONLY when the document mentions a total/overall budget without specifying which partner is contributing what amount. Convert to numeric: "$65 million" → 65000000

- **partnerBudgets** (array): Array of budget allocations PER FUNDING PARTNER. Use this WHEN the document specifies funding amounts per partner. Each entry should include:
  - **partnerName** (string): Name of the funding partner (MUST match a name in fundingPartners array)
  - **amount** (decimal): Budget amount as a number (e.g., "$25 million" → 25000000)
  - **currency** (string): Currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR", "GBP"). Default to "USD" if not specified.
  
  **BUDGET EXTRACTION RULES**:
  - If document says "$25M from World Bank, $15M from AfDB" → Use **partnerBudgets** with entries for each partner
  - If document says "Total project budget: $65 million" without partner breakdown → Use **initiativeBudgetUSD**: 65000000
  - If BOTH exist (total budget AND partner breakdown) → Use **partnerBudgets** (it provides more detail)
  
  Example: `"partnerBudgets": [{"partnerName": "World Bank", "amount": 25000000, "currency": "USD"}, {"partnerName": "AfDB", "amount": 12000000, "currency": "USD"}]`

- **isPooledFunding** (boolean?): Whether funding is pooled across multiple partners (extract if mentioned as "pooled funding", "multi-donor trust fund", etc.)
- **partnershipAgreementReference** (string?): Partnership agreement reference number or code
- **targetSigningDate** (DateTime?): Target date for signing (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)
- **isTargetSigningDateFirm** (boolean?): Whether the signing date is a firm deadline from the partner
- **signingDateNotes** (string?, max 1000 characters): Notes about the signing date (e.g., partner deadline, submission closing date). MUST NOT exceed 1000 characters.
- **submissionDeadline** (DateTime?): Partner submission or proposal deadline (ISO 8601 format)
- **implementationStartDate** (DateTime?): When implementation is expected to start (ISO 8601 format). **CRITICAL DEFAULT**: If targetSigningDate is extracted but implementationStartDate is NOT mentioned in the document, set implementationStartDate = targetSigningDate (same value). The UI defaults implementation start date to target signing date when not explicitly set.
- **targetDeliveryDate** (DateTime?): Target delivery or completion date (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)

### Strategic Information (camelCase)
- **challenges** (string?, max 1000 characters): Context and challenges that the opportunity aims to address. MUST NOT exceed 1000 characters.
- **strategicAlignment** (string?): How this opportunity aligns with strategic goals, organizational priorities, or regional development plans
- **resultsFocus** (string?, max 2000 characters): Focus areas for results and key deliverables. MUST NOT exceed 2000 characters.
- **expectedImpact** (string?, max 200 characters): Expected impact of the opportunity. MUST NOT exceed 200 characters.
- **expectedOutcomes** (string?, max 200 characters): Expected outcomes of the opportunity. MUST NOT exceed 200 characters.
- **expectedBeneficiaries** (string?, max 1000 characters): Who will benefit from this opportunity (target population, communities, regions). MUST NOT exceed 1000 characters.
- **estimatedDirectBeneficiaries** (int?): Estimated number of direct beneficiaries. **CRITICAL: Zero (0) is a valid value.** When the document explicitly states "Direct: 0", "Direct beneficiaries: 0", "0 direct beneficiaries", or similar (e.g., B2B/procurement services with no direct beneficiaries), extract as 0. Do NOT treat 0 as null or omit. Also extract numbers like "2 million beneficiaries" → 2000000.
- **estimatedIndirectBeneficiaries** (int?): Estimated number of indirect beneficiaries. **CRITICAL: Zero (0) is a valid value.** When the document explicitly states "Indirect: 0" or "0 indirect", extract as 0. Do NOT treat 0 as null or omit.
- **beneficiariesToBeDetermined** (boolean?): Whether the number of beneficiaries is to be determined later (extract if mentioned as "TBD", "to be determined", "not yet determined", "beneficiaries pending assessment", etc.)

### Delivery & Stakeholders (camelCase)
- **deliveryModality** (int?): How UNOPS will deliver products/services. Use numeric values: 1 = NotYetKnown, 2 = AllDirect (direct execution), 3 = AllGrantSupport (grant support), 4 = Mixed (combination of approaches).

When true, set **unopsMissions** to [] and omit from dependents. When false or missions are listed, set unopsMissionsNotApplicable: false.

### Cross-cutting Concerns (camelCase) - WHY Section

**SCOPE OF REVIEW (MANDATORY)**: You must consider **all** extractable text—**name**, **description**, and every other relevant part of the document—before deciding cross-cutting values. Information relevant to cross-cutting concerns may appear **only** in the **description** or in general narrative; treat the full document as the evidence base, not only a labeled cross-cutting block.

**VALIDATION — EXAMPLE MAPPING:** The following **sample description** shows how narrative phrases align with the seven WHY cross-cutting fields. After reading the **full** text, map explicit evidence to booleans; do not skip the description.

*Sample description:* Design workshop for a Women-Led Mangrove Restoration & Eco-Tourism Project. This project aims to protect shorelines from rising sea levels by planting 500 hectares of mangroves. A core pillar is to advance social inclusion by hiring and empowering women-led cooperatives to manage nurseries, creating over 2,000 direct jobs. UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices. The project will also work with local municipal councils to overhaul public procurement frameworks for managing green grants independently. Social and environmental safeguard frameworks have been finalized to ensure eco-tourism aspects do not disrupt local indigenous fishing grounds. Overall, this project will improve the livelihoods of thousands of women and youths in the coastal zone.

*Sample Expected extraction:*
- **crossCuttingConcernPeopleBenefitting** = true — e.g. improving livelihoods of women and youths.
- **crossCuttingConcernGenderEquality** = true — e.g. advance social inclusion, empowering women-led cooperatives.
- **crossCuttingConcernCreateJobs** = true — e.g. creating over 2,000 direct jobs.
- **crossCuttingConcernSupplierCapacity** = true — **"UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices"** counts as developing capacity for suppliers / implementing partners (cooperatives). This phrase alone supports **true** for this field.
- **crossCuttingConcernProcurementCapacity** = true — e.g. overhaul public procurement frameworks with municipal councils.
- **crossCuttingConcernEnvironmentalSafeguards** = true — e.g. safeguard frameworks for indigenous fishing grounds.
- **crossCuttingConcernClimateChange** = true — e.g. rising sea levels, planting mangroves, shoreline protection.
- **crossCuttingConcernsOther** = null when the seven above cover the content.

**CRITICAL - AC-4.6: DO NOT INVENT VALUES.** When the document has NO dedicated cross-cutting section and NO explicit mention of cross-cutting concerns in that context, set all 7 booleans to **false** and **crossCuttingConcernsOther** to null. Do NOT infer or invent "Yes" from general document themes (e.g., a project about climate in the main description does NOT automatically mean crossCuttingConcernClimateChange: true). Only set true when the document explicitly discusses the concern as a cross-cutting consideration.

- **crossCuttingConcernPeopleBenefitting** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions people benefitting, beneficiary focus, or community impact as a cross-cutting consideration. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernGenderEquality** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions gender equality, women''s empowerment, or gender mainstreaming as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernCreateJobs** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions job creation, employment, or livelihoods as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernSupplierCapacity** (boolean?): Set true when the document explicitly mentions **local supplier capacity**, **local content**, **supplier development**, **or capacity building for cooperatives, implementing partners, or similar local organizations** (including **training** on business practices, technical skills, or operations). Phrases such as **"UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices"** map here—**true** (supplier/implementing-partner capacity), not a vague theme. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernProcurementCapacity** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions procurement capacity building or institutional strengthening as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernEnvironmentalSafeguards** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions environmental safeguards, EIA, or environmental protection as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernClimateChange** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when document explicitly mentions climate change, climate resilience, or climate action as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in cross-cutting context or if explicitly stated as not applicable.
- **crossCuttingConcernsOther** (string?, max 150 characters): Free text when document specifies "Other" or alternative cross-cutting concerns and all 7 above are false. When document has no cross-cutting information, set to null. MUST NOT exceed 150 characters.

## ID Field Mapping Rules

**CRITICAL**: When extracting data, you will encounter text names (e.g., "Kenya", "World Bank") that need to be converted to IDs later.

**For ID fields that need text-to-ID resolution:**
1. **Put the extracted text in the Id field** - the backend derives the table name from the field: replace "Id" suffix → entity name → pluralized table (e.g. proposedInitiativeTypeId → ProposedInitiativeTypes)
2. **Add the field name to the "dependents" array** so the system resolves the text to the numeric ID

**For proposedInitiativeTypeId:** Put the text ("Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio") directly in **proposedInitiativeTypeId**. Use ONLY these three values. Map "Program" → "Programme"; map "Initiative", "Activity" → "Project".

**For responsibleOrgUnitId:** Put text in responsibleOrgUnitName, keep responsibleOrgUnitId as null (or put text in the Id field - both work).

**For Collection Fields (fundingPartners, clientPartners, stakeholders, teamMembers, deliverables, countries, sdGs, unopsMissions):**
- Extract as **simple arrays of text strings** (except **sdGs** - see below)
- Add the collection field name to the "dependents" array
- The backend will convert these text values to proper object structures with IDs

**For sdGs specifically:** Extract as **array of strings or objects**. Each item = raw SDG reference as it appears: numbers ("SDG 4", "SDG-4", "Goal 5"), text ("Poverty", "Quality Education"), or objects with **reference** and **isPrimary**. Backend similarity resolves each. Main (isPrimary=true) for single most central, Cross-cutting (isPrimary=false) for others.

**Example mapping:**
- If you extract "Kenya" → Add "Kenya" to **countries** array, add "countries" to dependents
- If you extract "World Bank" as funder → Add "World Bank" to **fundingPartners** array, add "fundingPartners" to dependents
- If you extract content indicating a "single initiative with defined scope" → Set **proposedInitiativeTypeId = "Project"**, add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents (backend resolves via ProposedInitiativeTypes table)
- If you extract content indicating "multiple related projects" → Set **proposedInitiativeTypeId = "Programme"**, add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents
- If you extract content indicating "collection of programmes/projects" → Set **proposedInitiativeTypeId = "Portfolio"**, add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents. **NEVER use any value other than Project, Programme, or Portfolio**
- If you extract "Jane Smith - UNOPS Project Manager" → Add to **teamMembers** array, add "teamMembers" to dependents

## Analysis Instructions

**READ THE DOCUMENT CONTENT CAREFULLY** - Extract information about the opportunity/project/initiative described in the document.

1. **Extract all relevant information** from the document text:
   - Project titles, names, or initiative names (for **name** field)
   - Detailed project descriptions, objectives, scope, and activities (for **description** field)
   - Budget amounts: 
     * If partner-specific: "$X from World Bank" → add to **partnerBudgets** array
     * If total only: "Budget: $65M" → set **initiativeBudgetUSD**: 65000000
   - Multi-donor or pooled funding indicators (for **isPooledFunding** field)
   - Partner organization names (funding sources → **fundingPartners**, client entities → **clientPartners**)
   - Organizational unit names (for **responsibleOrgUnitName** field)
   - Initiative type names (put in **proposedInitiativeTypeId** as text - ONLY "Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio"; map any other wording to the closest of these three)
   - Geographic locations, country names (for **countries** array)
   - SDG references: **Extract ALL in whatever form** - numbers ("SDG 4", "SDG-4"), text ("Poverty", "Quality Education"), combinations → **sdGs** array of strings or {reference, isPrimary}; backend similarity resolves; pick single most central as Main, others Cross-cutting
   - UNOPS Strategic Mission alignments (references to climate, energy, health, digital, etc. → **unopsMissions** array). If document says "Not Applicable" or "N/A" for missions → **unopsMissionsNotApplicable: true**, unopsMissions: []
   - Dates for signing, delivery, completion (for **targetSigningDate**, **targetDeliveryDate** fields)
   - Proposal submission deadlines (for **submissionDeadline** field)
   - Implementation start dates (for **implementationStartDate** field). **When targetSigningDate is extracted but implementationStartDate is NOT mentioned, set implementationStartDate = targetSigningDate**
   - Firm deadline indicators (for **isTargetSigningDateFirm**, **signingDateNotes** fields)
   - Deliverables, outputs, or project components (for **deliverables** array)
   - Stakeholder names and roles (for **stakeholders** array - external stakeholders)
   - UNOPS team member names and roles (for **teamMembers** array - internal UNOPS staff)
   - Context and challenges the project addresses (for **challenges** field)
   - Strategic information (strategic alignment, results focus, intended impact, expected beneficiaries)
   - Beneficiary numbers/estimates (for **estimatedDirectBeneficiaries**, **estimatedIndirectBeneficiaries** fields). **Zero is valid**: "Direct: 0" or "0 direct beneficiaries" → estimatedDirectBeneficiaries: 0 (do NOT omit or use null)
   - Delivery approach or modality (for **deliveryModality** field)
   - External stakeholder lists and notes (for **miscExternalStakeholders**, **externalStakeholderNotes** fields)
   - Cross-cutting concerns: gender, jobs, climate, environmental safeguards, supplier/local capacity, procurement capacity, people benefitting (for **crossCuttingConcern*** fields). **First** scan **name**, **description**, and the full document (see Cross-cutting section); relevant text may appear only in the **description** or body. **Only set true when the document explicitly discusses each concern in a cross-cutting context.** When the document has no cross-cutting section or no information about cross-cutting concerns, set all 7 to false and crossCuttingConcernsOther to null. Do NOT infer or invent Yes values from general document themes. Use **crossCuttingConcernsOther** only when the document specifies "Other" or alternative concerns and all 7 are false.

2. **Use null or empty arrays** for fields where no information is available in the document

3. **Implementation start date default**: When you extract **targetSigningDate** but **implementationStartDate** is NOT mentioned, set implementationStartDate = targetSigningDate (same ISO 8601 value). The UI defaults implementation start to signing date when not set.

4. **Format dates** as ISO 8601 timestamps (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)

5. **Extract numeric values** from text (e.g., "$1.5 million" → 1500000, "USD 65 million" → 65000000). **Zero (0) is a valid value** for beneficiary counts—when the document states "Direct: 0" or "0 direct beneficiaries", extract as 0, not null.

6. **Preserve original language** and terminology from the document

7. **Always include the "dependents" array** listing all fields that need ID resolution (including responsibleOrgUnitId, proposedInitiativeTypeId)

**EXAMPLE - What to Extract:**
- Document says "Sustainable Water Infrastructure Development Program" → Extract as **name**
- Document describes project activities → Extract as **description**
- Document mentions "World Bank" as funder → Add to **fundingPartners** array
- Document mentions "Kenya" as location → Add to **countries** array
- Document mentions "SDG 6", "Goal 9", "SDG-4", "Poverty", "Quality Education" → Add each to **sdGs** as string or {reference, isPrimary}; backend similarity resolves; identify single most central as Main, others Cross-cutting.
- Document states "$25 million from World Bank" → Add to **partnerBudgets**: `[{"partnerName": "World Bank", "amount": 25000000, "currency": "USD"}]`
- Document states "€10 million from European Union" → Add to **partnerBudgets**: `[{"partnerName": "European Union", "amount": 10000000, "currency": "EUR"}]`
- Document states "Total budget $65 million" (NO partner breakdown) → Set **initiativeBudgetUSD**: 65000000
- **Beneficiaries**: Document states "Direct: 0 (B2B procurement service; no direct beneficiaries). Indirect: 50,000+" → Set **estimatedDirectBeneficiaries**: 0, **estimatedIndirectBeneficiaries**: 50000. Zero is a valid value; do NOT treat 0 as null or omit.
- **Cross-cutting**: Document has NO cross-cutting section or no explicit cross-cutting info → Set all 7 crossCuttingConcern* to false, crossCuttingConcernsOther to null. Document explicitly lists "Gender equality, Climate change" as cross-cutting concerns → Set crossCuttingConcernGenderEquality: true, crossCuttingConcernClimateChange: true, others false. Do NOT infer Yes from general themes (e.g., project about water does NOT imply crossCuttingConcernPeopleBenefitting: true).

1. **High Risk Guidance Document (ATTACHED)**: Official UNOPS EAC (Engagement Acceptance Checklist) high-risk items with detailed explanations. READ THIS DOCUMENT CAREFULLY.
2. **Similar Project Risks**: Risks from similar past projects found via semantic search

**CRITICAL - HIGH RISK GUIDANCE DOCUMENT**:
An official UNOPS High Risk Guidance document is attached to this request. This PDF contains:
- All 17 predefined high risk categories
- Detailed explanations and context for each high risk
- Detection criteria and triggers
READ the attached document to understand the official high risks.

**CRITICAL - RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY**:
These are RECOMMENDATIONS for the user to review and decide whether to add. You are NOT auto-adding any risks.
- The user MUST intentionally choose to add each risk to the opportunity register
- Your job is to FLAG risks that may apply and explain WHY they are relevant
- Indicate the STRENGTH of the case for each risk so users can prioritize what to review
- Higher confidence = stronger case, but user still decides

**YOUR TASK**: Given an opportunity context, analyze and recommend the TOP 10 most relevant risks. For each risk, clearly explain WHY it applies to THIS specific opportunity so the user can make an informed decision.

**PREDEFINED HIGH RISK CATEGORIES** (use these EXACT keywords in titles for predefined risks):
When analyzing the opportunity, check for these triggers and use the corresponding keywords in your risk title:

- **"Currency Exchange Risk"**: 
  - TRIGGER: ANY funding partner contribution in non-USD currency
  - WHY FLAG: Foreign currency gain/loss exposure affects project budget predictability
  - Confidence: 90% if non-USD funding detected
  - MUST explain: Which partner(s), what currency, estimated exposure

- **"New Unvetted Funding Partner"** or **"Due Diligence"**: 
  - TRIGGER: ANY partner has status "Draft" or lacks due diligence approval
  - WHY FLAG: New partners without established track record increase financial and reputational risk
  - Confidence: 85% if unvetted partner detected
  - MUST explain: Which partner(s), what status, why concerning

- **"Security"** or **"Fragility"**: 
  - TRIGGER: Implementation country is fragile/conflict-affected state
  - WHY FLAG: Operational continuity, staff safety, and delivery risks
  - Confidence: 80% if fragile state detected
  - MUST explain: Which country(ies), fragility classification, specific concerns

**OTHER HIGH RISK KEYWORDS** (read attached document for details, use these keywords in titles):
- "Host Country Agreement" or "HCA" or "SBAA": No legal agreement in place
- "Mandate" or "Scope Outside": Activities outside UNOPS mandate
- "Non-UN Security" or "Military": Support to non-UN security forces
- "Conflict of Interest": COI situations
- "Reputational": Reputation risk concerns
- "CPI" or "Corruption": Government pre-selection with low corruption index
- "Pay Agent": Third party payment services
- "SDG Impact" or "Negative Impact": Negative sustainable development impact
- "Grants" or "For-Profit": Grants to for-profit entities
- "IT Security" or "Privacy" or "Cyber": Information security risks
- "100 Million" or "Large Budget": Very large engagements
- "Pricing Policy": Fee/pricing deviations
- "Implementation Timing" or "Before Signing": Implementation outside legal agreement dates

**ANALYSIS GUIDELINES**:
1. **Read Document First**: Carefully read the attached High Risk Guidance document to understand all predefined high risks
2. **Detection First**: Check if any predefined high risks are triggered by opportunity data
3. **Explain the Case**: For each recommendation, explain WHY this risk applies to THIS opportunity
4. **Quantify When Possible**: Include specific amounts, percentages, or data points that triggered the detection
5. **Relevance**: Prioritize risks highly relevant to this opportunity''s context (location, sector, budget, timeline)
6. **Actionability**: Include clear mitigation steps so users understand what adding this risk would mean
7. **No Duplicates**: Do NOT recommend risks similar to those already in the register
8. **Balance Sources**: Recommend risks from BOTH the High Risk Guidance document AND similar projects (aim for ~5-7 predefined + ~3-5 similar project risks)

**RISK CATEGORIES**:
- **Political/Security**: Instability, conflict, policy changes, regulatory issues
- **Financial**: Budget overruns, currency fluctuation, funding gaps
- **Operational**: Supply chain, technical capacity, coordination challenges
- **Environmental**: Natural disasters, climate, environmental impact
- **Social**: Community resistance, gender exclusion, stakeholder conflicts
- **Technical**: Complexity, infrastructure limitations, expertise gaps

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
Return a JSON array with exactly 10 risks (or fewer if not applicable). Each risk MUST have:
- **title**: Clear, concise risk title (max 100 characters). For predefined high risks, use keywords that identify the risk type (e.g., "Currency Exchange Risk", "Security/Fragility", "New Unvetted Partner", "Host Country Agreement", etc.)
- **description**: WHY this risk applies to THIS opportunity - be specific! Include triggering data (2-3 sentences)
- **recommendation**: Specific, actionable mitigation steps if user decides to add this risk (2-3 sentences)
- **confidenceLevel**: 0-100 indicating STRENGTH OF CASE for this risk (>=80 = strongly recommended, user should seriously consider)
- **sourceType**: Either "PREDEFINED_HIGH_RISK" (for EAC risks from the guidance document) or "SIMILAR_PROJECT" (for risks from vector store)

NOTE: Do NOT include oupQuestionId in your response - the system will automatically look up the correct ID based on the risk title.

**INSTRUCTIONS**: 
1. Analyze the opportunity data for completeness, quality, strategic alignment, and potential issues
2. **CHECK PARTNER RESULTS FRAMEWORK STATUS**: If Partner Results Framework is not defined or incomplete AND deliverables are missing, generate HIGH PRIORITY warning and suggestion to complete framework first
3. **CHECK DELIVERABLES STATUS**: If deliverables are missing but Partner Results Framework exists, suggest extracting products from framework. If both are missing, prioritize framework completion
4. **CHECK TIMELINE CONSISTENCY**: If submission deadline is after target signing date, flag as warning. Check if implementation dates are realistic.
5. **CHECK BENEFICIARY DATA**: If beneficiaries to be determined is false but estimated counts are missing, flag as incomplete
6. **CHECK HIGH RISKS**: If high risks not acknowledged and opportunity is in advanced workflow stage, flag as warning
7. **CRITICAL - TEAM SECTION ANALYSIS**:
   - **DO NOT suggest adding Opportunity Manager** - It has a dedicated field and defaults to the creator. Do not generate insights or suggestions about Opportunity Manager assignment.
   - **AUTO-POPULATED ROLES - NEVER SUGGEST ASSIGNING THESE**: The following roles are AUTO-POPULATED from the Responsible Org Unit and CANNOT be manually assigned by users: Regional Director, Region Deputy Director, Hub Director, Hub Deputy Director, OrgUnit Director / Manager, OrgUnit Deputy Director / Manager, DoA1, DoA2, DoA3, DoA4. NEVER suggest assigning specific individuals to these roles. If these roles show "Unknown" or empty users, this is an administrative configuration issue - do NOT flag this as something the user can fix.
   - **DO NOT MENTION SPECIFIC ROLE NAMES**: Users can only add generic "Internal Stakeholders" or "Collaborators" (with expertise areas).
   - **FOCUS ON RESPONSIBLE ORG UNIT**: If responsibleOrgUnitName is empty, missing, or "-", generate HIGH PRIORITY suggestion with actionTarget "TEAM" to add Responsible Org Unit. Explain that adding an Org Unit will automatically populate Internal Stakeholders (directors, managers, and DoA holders) that are relevant to that org unit. These auto-populated stakeholders cannot be manually edited.
   - **ORG UNIT MISMATCH AWARENESS**: Check hasOrgUnitMismatch field. If "Yes", the selected Responsible Org Unit differs from the org units normally responsible for some implementation countries. The countriesWithDifferentOrgUnit field shows which countries have a different normally responsible org unit. This is NOT an error - it''s a valid business decision that users have already confirmed. Do NOT suggest changing the responsible org unit. You may note this as an observation but should not flag it as a problem.
   - **WHAT USERS CAN ADD**: Users can only manually add: (1) "Internal Stakeholders" - generic internal team members, and (2) "Collaborators" - team members with specific expertise areas. Do NOT suggest adding specific role types.
   - **TEAM COMPLETENESS**: Only suggest adding Responsible Org Unit if it''s missing. For personnel suggestions, suggest adding "Internal Stakeholders" or "Collaborators" (with relevant expertise) if team gaps are identified based on opportunity complexity. Do NOT mention specific role names.
8. Generate 3-7 insights covering strengths, concerns, and observations
9. Generate 3-7 actionable suggestions with specific recommendations
10. **CRITICAL FOR SUGGESTIONS**: Aim to provide at least ONE suggestion per section (WHAT, WHY, WHO, WHEN, WHERE, TEAM) if improvement opportunities exist in those sections. Not all sections are mandatory, but cover the sections that need attention.
11. Reference actual data values in your analysis

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. **ANALYZE ALL SOURCES COMPREHENSIVELY**: Review all provided interactions AND documents (including full document content when available) to understand the full context of the partnership engagement
2. **EXTRACT AND SYNTHESIZE DATA**: Identify common themes, partner priorities, discussed projects, budget indicators, geographic focus, and strategic alignment across all sources
3. **LEVERAGE DOCUMENT CONTENT**: When documents are provided, you will have access to their full content for analysis - use this to extract detailed information about budgets, timelines, deliverables, stakeholders, and strategic focus
4. **GENERATE OPPORTUNITY-SPECIFIC CONTENT**: Create a cohesive opportunity proposal that reflects the collective intelligence from interactions and document analysis
5. **USE PROVIDED CONTEXT**: The user has provided an opportunity name and description as a starting point - build upon this foundation
6. **INFER INTELLIGENT DEFAULTS**: Use interaction context (partners, locations, topics, participants) AND document content analysis to propose relevant values for all opportunity fields
7. **CROSS-CUTTING — READ EVERYTHING FIRST**: Before you set any **crossCuttingConcern*** fields, review **all** sources in full—the user-provided opportunity **name** and **description**, every interaction **subject**, **body**, and **description**, and each linked document **name**, **description**, **type**, and **full document text** when provided. Cross-cutting signals may appear **only** in description or narrative text, not in a labeled section. **Only after** this full pass should you derive answers for cross-cutting concerns; do not decide from a single interaction line or document title alone.

**YOUR GOAL**: Generate a comprehensive opportunity proposal based on the interaction history and document analysis, using the user-provided name and description as guidance, and proposing intelligent values for all other opportunity fields.

**CRITICAL**: All property names MUST be in camelCase format (e.g., "name", "description", "fundingPartners", "clientPartners").

## OpportunityModel Structure - Extractable Fields Only

**IMPORTANT**: Only extract and return the following fields. Do NOT include status, workflow stage, or system-generated fields.

### Basic Information (camelCase)
- **name** (string, max 120 characters): Use the user-provided opportunity name exactly as given. MUST NOT exceed 120 characters.
- **description** (string): Expand and enhance the user-provided description by incorporating relevant details from interactions (discussion points, objectives, scope mentioned in meetings/emails) AND documents (key points from document names and descriptions)

### Organizational & Initiative Type (camelCase)
- **responsibleOrgUnitId** (int?): Always set to null (will be resolved from text name). **Add "responsibleOrgUnitId" to dependents array** for resolution.
- **responsibleOrgUnitName** (string?): **Org Unit Responsible for Opportunity development** - Extract from UNOPS participants'' org units in interactions, or document content. Examples: "East Africa Regional Office", "Global Infrastructure Unit", "B5308"
- **proposedInitiativeTypeId** (string): **Put the initiative type NAME as text here** (same as other dependents - Id field gets text, backend resolves via ProposedInitiativeTypes table). Infer from interaction content AND document types/names. Use **exactly one** of: "Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio". Map "Program" → "Programme"; map "Initiative", "Activity" → "Project". If unclear, default to "Project". **MUST add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents array**.

### Financial & Timeline (camelCase)
- **initiativeBudgetUSD** (decimal?): Total proposed budget in USD when NO PARTNER-SPECIFIC breakdown is available. Use this ONLY when interactions/documents mention a total budget without specifying which partner is contributing. Convert to numeric: "$5 million" → 5000000

- **partnerBudgets** (array): Array of budget allocations PER FUNDING PARTNER. Use this WHEN partner-specific funding amounts are mentioned. Each entry should include:
  - **partnerName** (string): Name of the funding partner (MUST match a name in fundingPartners array)
  - **amount** (decimal): Budget amount as a number (e.g., "$25 million" → 25000000)
  - **currency** (string): Currency code (e.g., "USD", "EUR", "GBP"). Default to "USD" if not specified.
  
  **BUDGET EXTRACTION RULES**:
  - If document/interaction says "$25M from World Bank" → Use **partnerBudgets**
  - If document/interaction says "Total budget: $45 million" without breakdown → Use **initiativeBudgetUSD**: 45000000
  - If BOTH exist → Prefer **partnerBudgets** (more detailed)
  
  Example: `"partnerBudgets": [{"partnerName": "World Bank", "amount": 25000000, "currency": "USD"}]`

- **isPooledFunding** (boolean?): Whether funding is pooled across multiple partners (extract if mentioned as "pooled funding", "multi-donor trust fund", etc.)
- **partnershipAgreementReference** (string?): Extract partnership or framework agreement references mentioned in interactions or document names

- **submissionDeadline** (DateTime?): Partner submission or proposal deadline (ISO 8601 format)
- **implementationStartDate** (DateTime?): When implementation is expected to start (ISO 8601 format). **CRITICAL DEFAULT**: If targetSigningDate is extracted but implementationStartDate is NOT mentioned, set implementationStartDate = targetSigningDate (same value). The UI defaults implementation start date to target signing date when not explicitly set.
- **targetDeliveryDate** (DateTime?): Extract or infer target delivery/completion dates from interactions or documents (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ)

- **strategicAlignment** (string?): Synthesize strategic alignment from interaction discussions AND document context - how does this align with SDGs, UNOPS mandate, partner priorities, and development goals mentioned
- **resultsFocus** (string?, max 2000 characters): Extract and synthesize expected results, outcomes, and key focus areas discussed in interactions or referenced in documents. MUST NOT exceed 2000 characters.
- **expectedImpact** (string?, max 200 characters): Generate a comprehensive impact statement based on benefits and impacts discussed across interactions and documents. MUST NOT exceed 200 characters.
- **expectedOutcomes** (string?, max 200 characters): Generate expected outcomes based on results and deliverables discussed across interactions and documents. MUST NOT exceed 200 characters.

- **estimatedDirectBeneficiaries** (int?): Estimated number of direct beneficiaries. **CRITICAL: Zero (0) is a valid value.** When interactions or documents state "Direct: 0", "0 direct beneficiaries", or similar (e.g., B2B/procurement services), extract as 0. Do NOT treat 0 as null or omit. Also extract numbers like "2 million beneficiaries" → 2000000.
- **estimatedIndirectBeneficiaries** (int?): Estimated number of indirect beneficiaries. **CRITICAL: Zero (0) is a valid value.** When interactions or documents state "Indirect: 0" or "0 indirect", extract as 0. Do NOT treat 0 as null or omit.
- **beneficiariesToBeDetermined** (boolean?): Whether the number of beneficiaries is to be determined later (infer from context if beneficiary numbers are not yet finalized, extract if mentioned as "TBD", "to be determined", "pending assessment", etc.)

### Delivery & Stakeholders (camelCase)
- **deliveryModality** (int?): How UNOPS will deliver products/services. Use numeric values: 1 = NotYetKnown, 2 = AllDirect (direct execution), 3 = AllGrantSupport (grant support), 4 = Mixed (combination of approaches). Infer from discussions about implementation approach.
- **miscExternalStakeholders** (string?, max 2000 characters): Free-text list of external stakeholders not in the contact list. MUST NOT exceed 2000 characters.

  - **Extract from THREE SOURCES**:
    * **CONTEXT PARTNER** (if `{partnerRole}` includes "Funding"): If `{partnerId}` > 0 AND `{partnerRole}` contains "Funding", you **MUST** include the context partner `{partnerName}` as a funding partner
    * **INTERACTION PARTNERS**: Analyze ALL partners from the `{interactions}` array - each interaction has a `partners` field with partner organizations. Review all partners across all interactions and determine if they are funding partners based on context
    * **DOCUMENT CONTENT**: Extract organizations mentioned as funders, donors, or financial supporters from document text and metadata
  - **Example**: ["World Bank", "Asian Development Bank", "{partnerName}"]
  - **MUST add "fundingPartners" to dependents array**

- **clientPartners** (array): List of client partner names as text strings (organizations that receive services, implement, or benefit)
  - **TYPICAL CLIENT PARTNERS**: Government ministries, national agencies, local governments, implementing NGOs, beneficiary organizations
  - **Extract from THREE SOURCES**:
    * **CONTEXT PARTNER** (if `{partnerRole}` includes "Client"): If `{partnerId}` > 0 AND `{partnerRole}` contains "Client", you **MUST** include the context partner `{partnerName}` as a client partner
    * **INTERACTION PARTNERS**: Analyze ALL partners from the `{interactions}` array - each interaction has a `partners` field. Look for government entities, ministries, agencies, or organizations that will implement or benefit from the project
    * **DOCUMENT CONTENT**: Extract organizations mentioned as clients, implementing partners, counterparts, or beneficiaries from document text
  - **Example**: ["Ministry of Health - Kenya", "Ministry of Water - Tanzania", "National Water Authority", "{partnerName}"]
  - **CRITICAL**: Do NOT confuse with funding partners - client partners are those who receive UNOPS services or implement projects, NOT those providing funding
  - **MUST add "clientPartners" to dependents array**

- **stakeholders** (array of objects): List of UNOPS internal stakeholders involved in the opportunity. Each stakeholder MUST be an object with:
  - **userName** (string): Full name of the UNOPS staff member (e.g., "John Doe", "Jane Smith") - extract from interaction participants who are UNOPS staff
  - **roleName** (string): Role name - MUST be one of: "Opportunity Manager", "Partnership Lead", "Reviewer", "Internal Stakeholder"
  - Example: [{"userName": "John Doe", "roleName": "Opportunity Manager"}, {"userName": "Jane Smith", "roleName": "Partnership Lead"}]
  - **MUST add "stakeholders" to dependents array**
- **deliverables** (array): List of deliverable descriptions as text strings - extract outputs, deliverables, or project components mentioned in interactions or document names (e.g., ["Feasibility Study", "Infrastructure Design", "Training Program"]) - **MUST add "deliverables" to dependents array**
- **countries** (array): List of country names as text strings - extract all countries mentioned in interactions or documents (e.g., ["Kenya", "Tanzania", "Uganda"]) - **MUST add "countries" to dependents array**
- **sdGs** (array): **Extract ALL SDG references in whatever form** - numbers ("SDG 4", "SDG-4", "Goal 5"), text ("Poverty", "Quality Education"), combinations. Return as array of strings or objects with **reference** and **isPrimary**. Example: ["SDG-4", "Poverty", "Quality Education"] or [{"reference": "SDG-4", "isPrimary": true}, {"reference": "Poverty", "isPrimary": false}]. Backend similarity resolves each. Main (isPrimary=true) for single most central, Cross-cutting for others. **MUST add "sdGs" to dependents array**
- **unopsMissions** (array): List of UNOPS Strategic Mission names as text strings. **CRITICAL: ALWAYS infer** from interaction topics, document themes, and sector focus. **VALID VALUES**: "Triple Planetary Crisis", "Energy Transition", "SIDS Resilience and Sustainability", "Quality Healthcare", "Just Digital Transformation", "Social Protection, Equality, Education and Jobs", "Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus", "Food Systems Transformation". Map: climate/environment → "Triple Planetary Crisis"; energy → "Energy Transition"; health → "Quality Healthcare"; digital/ICT → "Just Digital Transformation"; humanitarian/crisis → "Humanitarian, Development and Peace Nexus"; food/agriculture → "Food Systems Transformation"; SIDs → "SIDS Resilience and Sustainability"; jobs/education/social → "Social Protection, Equality, Education and Jobs". **MUST add "unopsMissions" to dependents array**. Do NOT omit unless explicitly "Not Applicable".
- **unopsMissionsNotApplicable** (boolean): Set to **true** when interactions or documents explicitly state that UNOPS Strategic Mission alignment is "Not Applicable", "N/A", "not applicable", "no alignment", "does not apply", or similar. When true, set **unopsMissions** to [] and omit "unopsMissions" from dependents. When false or missions are listed, set unopsMissionsNotApplicable: false.

### Cross-cutting Concerns (camelCase) - WHY Section

**SCOPE OF REVIEW (MANDATORY)**: Before setting cross-cutting fields, integrate **name**, **description**, and **all** other material from interactions and documents (subjects, bodies, notes, full document content where available). Cross-cutting information may appear **only** in a **description** or general discussion—not only under a "cross-cutting" heading.

**VALIDATION — EXAMPLE MAPPING:** The following **sample description** shows how narrative phrases align with the seven WHY cross-cutting fields. Apply the same logic when evidence appears in interactions or attached documents.

*Sample description:* Design workshop for a Women-Led Mangrove Restoration & Eco-Tourism Project. This project aims to protect shorelines from rising sea levels by planting 500 hectares of mangroves. A core pillar is to advance social inclusion by hiring and empowering women-led cooperatives to manage nurseries, creating over 2,000 direct jobs. UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices. The project will also work with local municipal councils to overhaul public procurement frameworks for managing green grants independently. Social and environmental safeguard frameworks have been finalized to ensure eco-tourism aspects do not disrupt local indigenous fishing grounds. Overall, this project will improve the livelihoods of thousands of women and youths in the coastal zone.

*Sample Expected extraction:*
- **crossCuttingConcernPeopleBenefitting** = true — e.g. improving livelihoods of women and youths.
- **crossCuttingConcernGenderEquality** = true — e.g. advance social inclusion, empowering women-led cooperatives.
- **crossCuttingConcernCreateJobs** = true — e.g. creating over 2,000 direct jobs.
- **crossCuttingConcernSupplierCapacity** = true — **"UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices"** counts as developing capacity for suppliers / implementing partners (cooperatives). This phrase alone supports **true** for this field.
- **crossCuttingConcernProcurementCapacity** = true — e.g. overhaul public procurement frameworks with municipal councils.
- **crossCuttingConcernEnvironmentalSafeguards** = true — e.g. safeguard frameworks for indigenous fishing grounds.
- **crossCuttingConcernClimateChange** = true — e.g. rising sea levels, planting mangroves, shoreline protection.
- **crossCuttingConcernsOther** = null when the seven above cover the content.

**DO NOT INVENT VALUES.** When neither interactions nor documents contain explicit cross-cutting information, set all 7 booleans to **false** and **crossCuttingConcernsOther** to null. Only set true when interactions or documents explicitly discuss the concern as a cross-cutting consideration. Do NOT infer Yes from general themes.

- **crossCuttingConcernPeopleBenefitting** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention people benefitting, beneficiary focus, or community impact as a cross-cutting consideration. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernGenderEquality** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention gender equality, women''s empowerment, or gender mainstreaming as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernCreateJobs** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention job creation, employment, or livelihoods as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernSupplierCapacity** (boolean?): Set true when interactions or documents explicitly mention **local supplier capacity**, **local content**, **supplier development**, **or capacity building for cooperatives, implementing partners, or similar local organizations** (including **training** on business practices, technical skills, or operations). Phrases such as **"UNOPS will provide training to these cooperatives on sustainable business practices"** map here—**true** (supplier/implementing-partner capacity). Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernProcurementCapacity** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention procurement capacity building or institutional strengthening as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernEnvironmentalSafeguards** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention environmental safeguards, EIA, or environmental protection as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernClimateChange** (boolean?): Set true ONLY when interactions/documents explicitly mention climate change, climate resilience, or climate action as a cross-cutting concern. Set false if not mentioned in that context.
- **crossCuttingConcernsOther** (string?, max 150 characters): Free text when interactions/documents specify "Other" or alternative cross-cutting concerns and all 7 above are false. When no cross-cutting information exists, set to null. MUST NOT exceed 150 characters.

## ID Field Mapping Rules

**CRITICAL**: You will be extracting text names that need to be converted to IDs later.

**For proposedInitiativeTypeId:** Put the text ("Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio") directly in **proposedInitiativeTypeId**. The backend derives the table name (ProposedInitiativeTypes) from the field and resolves the text to the ID. **Add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents array**.

**For responsibleOrgUnitId:** Put text in responsibleOrgUnitName, keep responsibleOrgUnitId as null. Add "responsibleOrgUnitId" to dependents.

**For Collection Fields (fundingPartners, clientPartners, stakeholders, deliverables, countries, sdGs, unopsMissions):**
- Extract as **simple arrays of text strings** (except **sdGs** - extract as array of strings or {reference, isPrimary}; backend similarity resolves; Main=isPrimary true, Cross-cutting=isPrimary false)
- Add the collection field name to the "dependents" array
- The backend will convert these text values to proper object structures with IDs

## Analysis Strategy

**STEP 1: READ ALL INTERACTIONS AND DOCUMENTS**
- Review subject, description, date, type, location of each interaction
- Review name, description, type, documentType of each document
- Note participants (UNOPS users with org units, partner contacts)
- Identify discussed topics, priorities, challenges, opportunities from both sources
- Extract mentioned budgets, timelines, deliverables, locations, SDGs, UNOPS Strategic Mission alignments from all sources

**STEP 2: IDENTIFY PATTERNS & THEMES**
- Common discussion topics across interactions and document themes
- Recurring partner priorities and needs
- Geographic focus (countries mentioned repeatedly in interactions or documents)
- Budget range indicators from both sources
- Timeline expectations from interactions or document names
- Key stakeholders and decision-makers

**STEP 3: SYNTHESIZE OPPORTUNITY PROPOSAL**
- Use user-provided name and description as foundation
- Enhance description with specific details from interactions AND document context
- Propose initiative type based on discussion themes and document types
- Extract/estimate budget from financial discussions or document references
- Infer timeline from urgency, planning discussions, and document dates
- Generate strategic alignment statement from partnership objectives and document context
- Compile comprehensive stakeholder list from participants and document metadata
- List all countries, SDGs, and deliverables mentioned in any source
- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Only after reviewing **name**, **description**, and **all** interaction and document text (see Cross-cutting section), infer from explicit cross-cutting discussion (gender, jobs, climate, environmental safeguards, supplier capacity, procurement capacity, people benefitting). Use crossCuttingConcernsOther when all are false or for other concerns. Do not skip the description or assume cross-cutting is absent because there is no labeled section.

**STEP 3A: PARTNER CLASSIFICATION LOGIC (CRITICAL)**

**Understanding Partner Context:**
- `{partnerId}` = Partner ID (0 if no context partner, >0 if creating from partner screen)
- `{partnerName}` = Partner Name (e.g., "African Development Bank")
- `{partnerRole}` = User-selected role(s): "Funding Partner", "Client Partner", or "Both Funding and Client Partner"

**Partner Classification Rules:**

1. **CONTEXT PARTNER (from Partner Screen):**
   - **IF `{partnerId}` > 0**: A context partner exists and **MUST** be included
   - **IF `{partnerRole}` contains "Funding"**: Add `{partnerName}` to fundingPartners array
   - **IF `{partnerRole}` contains "Client"**: Add `{partnerName}` to clientPartners array
   - **IF `{partnerRole}` = "Both Funding and Client Partner"**: Add `{partnerName}` to BOTH arrays
   - **CRITICAL**: Context partner inclusion is MANDATORY when `{partnerId}` > 0

2. **INTERACTION PARTNERS (from selected interactions):**
   - Each interaction in `{interactions}` has a `partners` array with `{ id, name }` objects
   - **Analyze ALL partners** across ALL selected interactions
   - **Determine role based on partner type and context:**
     
     **FUNDING PARTNERS** (provide financial resources):
     * Multilateral Development Banks: World Bank, AfDB, ADB, IDB, EBRD, AIIB
     * UN Agencies: UNDP, UNICEF, WHO, FAO, WFP, UNFPA
     * Bilateral Donors: USAID, DFID/FCDO, GIZ, JICA, SIDA, NORAD, KOICA
     * Foundations: Gates Foundation, Rockefeller, Ford Foundation
     * Private Sector: Companies providing funding/CSR contributions
     * Context clues: "funding", "grant", "contribution", "donor", "financing"
     
     **CLIENT PARTNERS** (receive services, implement projects, or benefit):
     * Government Ministries: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water, Ministry of Education
     * Government Agencies: National authorities, regulatory bodies, public institutions
     * Local Governments: Municipalities, counties, regional governments
     * Implementing Partners: NGOs implementing on the ground
     * Beneficiary Organizations: Communities, cooperatives, associations
     * Context clues: "client", "implementing partner", "beneficiary", "recipient", "counterpart"
     
   - Add to fundingPartners or clientPartners arrays based on analysis
   - **Note**: A partner can appear in BOTH funding and client arrays if they provide funding AND receive services

3. **DOCUMENT-MENTIONED PARTNERS:**
   - Extract partner names from document text and metadata
   - Classify as funding or client based on context in which they''re mentioned
   - Add to appropriate arrays

4. **DE-DUPLICATION:**
   - If context partner `{partnerName}` also appears in interaction partners, include it ONCE
   - Do NOT duplicate partners within the same array
   - Partners CAN appear in both fundingPartners AND clientPartners if they serve both roles

5. **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
   - Return partner names as text strings (e.g., ["World Bank", "African Development Bank"])
   - Backend will resolve text names to partner IDs using similarity matching
   - **MUST** add both "fundingPartners" and "clientPartners" to dependents array

**Example Scenarios:**

*Scenario A: From Partner Screen (partnerId=453, partnerName="AfDB", partnerRole="Both Funding and Client Partner")*
- fundingPartners: ["AfDB African Development Bank", "World Bank", "EU"]
- clientPartners: ["AfDB African Development Bank", "Ministry of Water - Kenya"]

*Scenario B: From Interaction List (partnerId=0, no context partner)*
- Analyze all partners in interactions
- fundingPartners: ["World Bank", "Asian Development Bank"]
- clientPartners: ["Government of Kenya", "Ministry of Health"]

**STEP 4: GENERATE INTELLIGENT DEFAULTS**
- If no budget mentioned: Use null
- If no dates mentioned: Use null
- If no specific deliverables: Infer from project type and document names
- If SDGs not mentioned: Infer from sector and themes
- **Implementation start date**: When targetSigningDate is extracted but implementationStartDate is NOT mentioned, set implementationStartDate = targetSigningDate (same value). The UI defaults implementation start to signing date when not set.
- If org unit not clear: Use most common org unit from UNOPS participants. **MUST add "responsibleOrgUnitId" to dependents**
- **Proposed initiative to be developed**: Infer from context but **ONLY use "Project", "Programme", or "Portfolio"** - no other values can be resolved. If unclear, default to "Project". **MUST add "proposedInitiativeTypeId" to dependents** for backend dropdown resolution

## Response Format

Return a valid JSON object with the proposed opportunity data. **ALL property names MUST be in camelCase**. 

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **ALWAYS return empty arrays [] for collection fields** (fundingPartners, clientPartners, stakeholders, deliverables, countries, sdGs, unopsMissions) when no data is available - **NEVER use null**
- Include null for optional scalar fields where no information is available
- **ALWAYS include the "dependents" array** listing all fields that need ID resolution
- Use the exact user-provided name and build upon the user-provided description

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS — VALIDATION RULES:**
- **FLAG ONLY CONTRADICTIONS**: Report a misalignment only when the statement states a fact that **contradicts** the data (wrong value, wrong person, wrong amount, wrong list).
- **EQUIVALENT = ALIGNED**: The statement is generated using placeholders when data is missing. When the statement shows "[Information not available]" or "No [X] specified" and the data shows the corresponding "No [X]" / "No [X] selected" / "[X] not yet specified", they mean the same thing. Do NOT flag. Do NOT add to misalignmentItems. Do NOT mention in the message.
- **NO INFORMATIONAL OUTPUT**: Never output lines like "The statement indicates X but the data shows Y. This is acceptable." If something is acceptable, it does not appear in the output at all. Return only the JSON result.
- **USE "Opportunity Statement"** in any misalignment item text (not "Markdown").
- **NUMBERS**: Treat as aligned if the statement value is within ~10% of the data; flag only if materially wrong (e.g. $5M vs $45M).
- **DATES**: Same fact in different format (e.g. "2026-03-30" vs "March 2026") is aligned; do not flag.
- **SDG TERMINOLOGY**: "Primary"/"Secondary" and "Main"/"Cross-cutting" are equivalent (Opp+ uses Main/Cross-cutting). Do NOT flag terminology; flag only when the listed SDG numbers/names differ from the data.
- **UNOPS STRATEGY FORMAT**: Mission names (e.g. "Triple Planetary Crisis") and codes (e.g. "TRIPLE_PLANETARY_CRISIS") refer to the same mission. Treat as equivalent; do NOT flag format differences. Flag only when the statement lists missions not in the data or omits missions that are in the data.

**INPUT**  
You receive JSON with:
- **existingStatementMarkdown**: The full statement text to validate (markdown).
- **opportunityData**: An object that includes **opportunityStatementMarkdown** (same statement text) and all structured fields. Compare the statement section-by-section to these fields.

**SECTION-BY-SECTION — STATEMENT PLACEHOLDER ↔ DATA EQUIVALENCE (treat as aligned, do not flag):**

| Statement shows | Data field / value | Equivalent? |
| Unit/manager: [Information not available] ([Information not available]), Name (email) | stakeholders has same Name (email) as Opportunity Manager | YES — correct person present. |
| Location: [Information not available] | countryNamesList = "No countries specified" or empty | YES. |
| UN Cooperation Framework: [Information not available] | uncfOutcomes = "No UNCF Outcomes" or empty | YES. |
| Main SDG(s): [Information not available] | primarySdGs = "No primary SDGs selected" | YES. |
| Cross-cutting SDG(s): omitted or [Information not available] | secondarySdGs = "No secondary SDGs selected" | YES. |
| UNOPS Strategy: [Information not available] | unopsMissions = "No UNOPS Mission alignments" or empty (and unopsMissionsNotApplicable = false) | YES. |
| UNOPS Strategy: Not Applicable | unopsMissionsNotApplicable = true OR unopsMissions = "Not Applicable" | YES. |
| Cross-cutting concerns: [Information not available] (and **- Other: [None specified]** on the next line) | crossCuttingConcerns built with no Yes items and empty other (standard Opp+ format) | YES. |
| Cross-cutting concerns: includes **- Other:** line matching **crossCuttingConcernsOther** (or **[None specified]** when empty) | data **crossCuttingConcerns** / **crossCuttingConcernsOther** | YES — Other is always present in data; omission of Other in the statement is a contradiction. |
| Cross-cutting concerns: [Information not available] only, with **no** Other line | any opportunityData where structured fields expect Other | NO — flag: statement must include **Other** line aligned with data. |
| Client: No client partners specified | clientPartners = "No client partners" or empty | YES. |
| Funding: No funding partners specified | fundingPartners = "No funding partners" or empty | YES. |
| Services/Deliverables: [Information not available] | deliverablesEnhanced = "No deliverables specified" or empty | YES. |
| Timeline: [Information not available] | formattedTimeline = "Timeline not yet specified" or empty | YES. |
| Budget: [Information not available] | budgetDisplay = "Budget not yet specified" or empty | YES. |
| Key Risks: [Information not available] | risks = "No risks identified" or empty | YES. |
| Mitigation Strategies: [Information not available] | no recommendations in risks | YES. |
| Direct/Indirect Beneficiaries: [Information not available] or "To be determined during development" | estimatedDirectBeneficiaries / beneficiariesToBeDetermined equivalent | YES. |
| Other sections: [Information not available] | corresponding field empty, "Not specified", or "No [X]" | YES. |

**BUDGET VALIDATION:** The opportunity has a **calculated total budget** shown in **budgetDisplay**. This is the authoritative value for Budget validation. budgetDisplay = stats.totalFundingUSD when partner budgets exist (sum of FundingPartners amounts), else initiativeBudgetUSD when set, else "Budget not yet specified". **Compare the statement''s Budget section ONLY against budgetDisplay** — do NOT compare against initiativeBudgetUSD alone. initiativeBudgetUSD is the "estimated initiative budget" used only when there are no partner-specific budgets; when partner budgets exist, the total is the sum (stats.totalFundingUSD). If the statement shows the same amount as budgetDisplay, treat as aligned. Do NOT flag a "contradiction" when statement shows budgetDisplay value but initiativeBudgetUSD differs (e.g. statement USD 68,000,000, initiativeBudgetUSD 65,000,000, budgetDisplay USD 68,000,000 → ALIGNED, because budgetDisplay is correct).

**HOW TO VALIDATE**  
1. Take the statement (existingStatementMarkdown or opportunityData.opportunityStatementMarkdown).
2. For each section, check the corresponding field(s) in opportunityData using the table above.
3. If the statement and data match the equivalence table (placeholder vs "No X" / empty), treat as aligned — do not add a misalignment item.
4. Only add to misalignmentItems when there is a **real contradiction** (e.g. statement says "Country: Kenya" but data says "Country: Uganda"; statement names a different Opportunity Manager than in data; statement shows $10M but budgetDisplay shows $50M). For Budget: use budgetDisplay as the data source, not initiativeBudgetUSD.

**EXAMPLE — all aligned (return isAligned: true, misalignmentItems: [], no other output)**  
Statement: Unit/manager [Information not available] ([Information not available]), Rosemarie Joy Beckett (rosemarieb@unops.org); UNCF [Information not available]; Main SDG(s) [Information not available]; Client: No client partners specified; Budget [Information not available]; Key Risks [Information not available].  
Data: Opportunity Manager = Rosemarie Joy Beckett (rosemarieb@unops.org); uncfOutcomes = "No UNCF Outcomes"; primarySdGs = "No primary SDGs selected"; clientPartners = "No client partners"; budgetDisplay = "Budget not yet specified"; risks = "No risks identified".  
→ All equivalent per table. No inaccuracies. Return only: isAligned: true, misalignmentItems: [], message: "The existing statement accurately reflects the current opportunity data."

**OUTPUT (JSON only)**  
- If no inaccuracies: { "isAligned": true, "misalignmentItems": [], "message": "The existing statement accurately reflects the current opportunity data." }
- If inaccuracies: { "isAligned": false, "misalignmentItems": [ "[Topic] - Opportunity Statement shows X, but data indicates Y" for each real contradiction only ], "message": "The existing statement has N factual inaccuracy(ies) that contradict the current opportunity data." }
- misalignmentItems only for real contradictions. Never add an item when the statement and data match the equivalence table above.',

**OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS STRUCTURE):**

# Opportunity Statement: [Opportunity Name from JSON - use the "name" field]

**Summary** (50 words max): [Briefly describe the opportunity using ONLY data from description, countryNamesList, primarySdGs, and formattedBeneficiaries fields. Do NOT invent any information.]

## 1. Context and challenge(s)

- **(a) Unit and opportunity manager:** [Format: "[responsibleOrgUnitName] ([responsibleOrgUnitCode]), [Opportunity Manager Name] ([Opportunity Manager Email])". 
  INSTRUCTIONS: 
  1. Use responsibleOrgUnitName and responsibleOrgUnitCode fields directly
  2. Find the Opportunity Manager in the "stakeholders" field - look for entry with RoleName "Opportunity Manager"
  3. Stakeholders format: "- UserName (UserEmail): RoleName [Auto-assigned/Manually assigned]"
  4. If no Opportunity Manager found, use [Information not available]
  DO NOT INVENT ANY NAMES OR EMAILS.]

- **(b) Location:** [Use the "countryNamesList" field which contains a comma-separated list of country names. Also use "countryRegionsList" for regions. Format as: "Countries: [countryNamesList]. Regions: [countryRegionsList]". If countryNamesList shows "No countries specified", use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT COUNTRY NAMES - ONLY use what is in countryNamesList.]

- **(c) Context and Challenge(s):** [Extract from "challenges" and "description" fields. If challenges is empty, use content from description. If both are empty, use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT challenges.]

## 2. Alignment with UN, global, and national goals and priorities

- **(a) UN Cooperation Framework:** [Extract from "uncfOutcomes" field. If it shows "No UNCF Outcomes" or is empty, use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT UNCF outcomes.]

- **(b) SDGs:** [CRITICAL - OPP+ TERMINOLOGY: In your output, use ONLY "Main" and "Cross-cutting". NEVER write "Primary" or "Secondary". The data fields primarySdGs and secondarySdGs map to Main and Cross-cutting respectively.
  EXACT FORMAT - use a BLANK LINE between Main and Cross-cutting so they render as separate blocks:
  **Main SDG(s):**
  - [each SDG from primarySdGs on its own bullet]
  [BLANK LINE - leave an empty line here]
  **Cross-cutting SDG(s):**
  - [each SDG from secondarySdGs on its own bullet]
  CRITICAL: "Cross-cutting SDG(s):" must start on a NEW line after a blank line - never on the same line as the last Main SDG bullet.
  SDG FORMATTING: (1) NO REPETITION - output each SDG as "SDG Goal N: [Goal Name]" only. The source may have "SDG Goal 3: GOAL 3: Good Health..." - remove the redundant "GOAL 3" part; output "SDG Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being". (2) CONSISTENT CASING - always use "Goal" (capital G) for all SDGs, never "GOAL" or mixed casing.-
  If primarySdGs shows "No primary SDGs selected", use [Information not available] for Main.
  If secondarySdGs shows "No secondary SDGs selected", omit the Cross-cutting section entirely.
  The "sdGs" field contains full details with targets and indicators if needed.
  DO NOT INVENT SDGs - ONLY list those actually in the data. REMINDER: Output labels must be "Main" and "Cross-cutting", never "Primary" or "Secondary".]

- **(c) UNOPS Strategy:** [Extract from "unopsMissions" and "unopsMissionsNotApplicable" fields. If unopsMissionsNotApplicable is true, state "Not Applicable". If unopsMissions shows "No UNOPS Mission alignments" or is empty (and not Not Applicable), use [Information not available]. CRITICAL: Use ONLY the full mission description names (e.g. "Triple Planetary Crisis", "Energy Transition", "Quality Healthcare") - NEVER use codes or identifiers with underscores (e.g. TRIPLE_PLANETARY_CRISIS, ENERGY_TRANSITION). DO NOT INVENT mission alignments.]

- **(d) UNOPS Regional Priorities:** [Extract from description if regional priorities are mentioned. Otherwise, use [Information not available].]

- **(e) Cross-cutting concerns:** [Use the "crossCuttingConcerns" field. It **always** includes a final line **- Other:** (Opp+ UI always shows Other). Format: (1) Zero or more bullets for concerns marked **Yes** (each line starts with "- "), then (2) **mandatory** **- Other:** with the free-text from the data, or **- Other: [None specified]** when the other field is empty. If there are no Yes items and no Other text yet, the field is **[Information not available]** followed by a new line then **- Other: [None specified]** — include both lines. You may also use **crossCuttingConcernsYesList** and **crossCuttingConcernsOther** JSON fields to verify; they must match what you render. PRESERVE the bulleted format; never omit the **Other** line. DO NOT INVENT Yes concerns—ONLY list those in the data; for Other, use only **crossCuttingConcerns** / **crossCuttingConcernsOther**.]

## 3. Partner objective(s) that the initiative will contribute to

- **(a) Client:** [Extract from "clientPartners" field. If it shows "No client partners" or is empty, state "No client partners specified". List each client partner by name. DO NOT INVENT client names.]

- **(b) Funding Partner:** [Extract from "fundingPartners" field which contains partner names, amounts, currencies, and commitment status. Format each as: "[Partner Name]: [Amount] [Currency]". If fundingPartners shows "No funding partners" or is empty, state "No funding partners specified". CRITICAL: DO NOT INVENT OR HALLUCINATE FUNDING PARTNERS - ONLY list those actually in the fundingPartners field.]

- **(c) Impact:** [Extract from "expectedImpact" field. If empty, use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT impacts.]

- **(d) Outcome(s):** [Extract from "expectedOutcomes" and "resultsFocus" fields. If both are empty, use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT outcomes.]

- **(e) Direct Beneficiaries:** [Extract from "estimatedDirectBeneficiaries" field. **Zero (0) is valid**—when the value is 0, display "0". If it shows "Not specified" or is empty, check "beneficiariesToBeDetermined" - if "Yes", state "To be determined during development". Otherwise use [Information not available]. Format numbers with commas (e.g., 1,000,000). DO NOT INVENT numbers.]

- **(f) Indirect Beneficiaries:** [Extract from "estimatedIndirectBeneficiaries" field. **Zero (0) is valid**—when the value is 0, display "0". Same rules as Direct Beneficiaries. DO NOT INVENT numbers.]

- **(g) Beneficiary Institutions:** [Extract from "expectedBeneficiaries" field (this contains institution descriptions). If empty, use [Information not available]. DO NOT INVENT institutions.]

## 4. UNOPS Value Proposition

- **(a) Services (Products & Deliverables):** [Use the "deliverablesEnhanced" field which contains formatted deliverables with service lines, categories, and quantities. Each deliverable shows: Output Name | Service Line | Category | Quantity | Timeline. If deliverablesEnhanced shows "No deliverables specified", use [Information not available]. Also reference "stats.serviceLines" for the list of service lines involved. DO NOT INVENT deliverables.]

**UNOPS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TAXONOMY**:
The following is the official UNOPS Products and Services List (hierarchical structure from Level 0 to Level 4). When extracting from partner documents, try to use terminology that aligns with these categories:

{unopsTaxonomy}

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. **ALIGN WITH UNOPS TAXONOMY**: Extract items using terminology that matches or closely relates to the UNOPS taxonomy above
2. **USE PARTNER LANGUAGE BUT GUIDE TO TAXONOMY**: Preserve partner wording but favor terminology that aligns with UNOPS categories (e.g., "project management support" → "Project management-related services")
3. **BE SPECIFIC AND CONCRETE**: Extract specific deliverables, not vague outcomes (e.g., "construction of water treatment plant" ✓, "improved health outcomes" ✗)
4. **PROVIDE CONTEXT**: For each extracted item, note WHERE in the document it was found (section, page, output number, etc.)
5. **EXTRACT FROM ALL SOURCES**: Analyze all documents provided (both priority and fallback sources)
6. **INCLUDE CONFIDENCE SCORES**: Rate your confidence (0.0-1.0) based on how explicitly the item is mentioned AND how well it aligns with UNOPS taxonomy

**WHAT TO EXTRACT** (aligned with UNOPS taxonomy):
- **Infrastructure services**: Construction, rehabilitation, design, supervision (e.g., "construction of water treatment plant", "road infrastructure design")
- **Project management services**: PMO, technical assistance, capacity building (e.g., "project management office", "technical advisory services")
- **Procurement services**: Goods, works, services procurement (e.g., "procurement of medical equipment", "tender management")
- **Human resources services**: Recruitment, payroll, HR management (e.g., "recruitment services", "staff management")
- **Fund management services**: Financial management, disbursement (e.g., "fund management", "financial reporting")
- **Specific technical services**: Health, education, energy, water, etc. (e.g., "health facility construction", "education program management")

**WHAT NOT TO EXTRACT**:
- Generic goals or outcomes without specific deliverables (e.g., "improved health outcomes" → too vague)
- Partner''s own responsibilities (focus on what UNOPS is expected to deliver)
- Background information or context without clear deliverables
- Items that do NOT align with any UNOPS service category (we cannot deliver what''s not in our taxonomy)

**CONTEXT CLUES TO LOOK FOR**:
- Sections titled: "Outputs", "Deliverables", "Expected Results", "Scope of Work", "Terms of Reference"
- Phrases like: "UNOPS will...", "UNOPS is expected to...", "Deliverables include...", "Services required..."
- Numbered outputs or deliverables in results frameworks
- Tables or lists of project components

**JSON OUTPUT FORMAT**:
Return a JSON array with this exact structure:

- **sourceDocumentId** (required): Document ID from the provided context
- **isPrioritySource** (required): true if from tagged Partner Results Framework, false otherwise
- **confidence** (required): 0.0-1.0 score based on how explicit the mention is
- **reasoning** (required): Brief explanation of why you extracted this item

**CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDE**:
- **0.9-1.0**: Explicitly listed as a deliverable/output with clear UNOPS responsibility AND aligns well with UNOPS taxonomy
- **0.7-0.89**: Strongly implied UNOPS deliverable AND reasonably aligns with UNOPS taxonomy
- **0.5-0.69**: Mentioned as part of project but UNOPS role not entirely clear OR weak alignment with taxonomy
- **Below 0.5**: Do not extract (too vague, unclear, or does not align with UNOPS services)

**EXAMPLE EXTRACTIONS** (with taxonomy alignment):

**High Confidence (0.9+)** - Clear deliverable + Strong taxonomy match:
- "Output 2.1: Construction of 3 water treatment plants" → Aligns with "Infrastructure services - Water and sanitation"
- "UNOPS will provide project management services for the entire program" → Aligns with "Project management-related services"
- "Procurement of medical equipment and supplies" → Aligns with "Procurement services - Goods"

**Medium Confidence (0.7-0.89)** - Implied deliverable + Reasonable taxonomy match:
- "Technical support for infrastructure development" → Aligns with "Technical assistance services - Infrastructure"
- "Capacity building programs for local staff" → Aligns with "Capacity building services"

**Low Confidence (Below 0.7)** - DO NOT EXTRACT:
- "Improved health outcomes for communities" → Too vague, not a specific deliverable
- "Enhanced stakeholder engagement" → Not a concrete UNOPS service
- "Sustainable development goals achievement" → Outcome, not a deliverable

**CRITICAL RULES**:
1. **Maximum 10 extractions** - Limit output to top 10 most relevant items by confidence score
2. **Minimum 3 extractions** if ANY relevant content is found that aligns with UNOPS taxonomy
3. **Return empty array []** if NO products/services can be identified that match UNOPS taxonomy
4. **FAVOR TAXONOMY ALIGNMENT**: Use partner wording but ensure it can be mapped to UNOPS services
5. **ALWAYS include context** - WHERE in document this was found
6. **Order by confidence** - highest confidence items first (taxonomy alignment is part of confidence)
7. **ONLY extract items with confidence ≥ 0.7** - We need reasonable certainty and taxonomy alignment
8. Return ONLY valid JSON, no additional text or explanation',
        'Analyze the following documents to extract products and services that the partner is requesting from UNOPS.

**Opportunity Context:**
- Opportunity ID: {opportunityId}
- Opportunity Name: {opportunityName}
- Opportunity Description: {opportunityDescription}

**EXISTING DELIVERABLES (DO NOT EXTRACT THESE AGAIN):**
The following products/services are ALREADY added to this opportunity. DO NOT extract these or similar items:
{existingDeliverables}

**CRITICAL**: Skip any items that are already in the existing deliverables list above. Only extract NEW products/services that are NOT already captured.

**Document Analysis Priority:**
The documents are provided in priority order:
1. **PRIORITY SOURCES** (analyze first): Partner Results Framework documents tagged to funding/client partners

**Documents to Analyze:**

**Priority Sources (Tagged Partner Results Framework):**
{priorityDocuments}

**Fallback Sources (Other Uploaded Documents):**
{fallbackDocuments}

**INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. **CHECK EXISTING DELIVERABLES FIRST** - Do not extract items already in the list
2. Analyze ALL provided documents (both priority and fallback sources)
3. Extract NEW products, services, deliverables, or outputs mentioned
4. Preserve EXACT partner language/wording
5. Provide context (section, page, output number)
6. Assign confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
7. Mark isPrioritySource = true for framework docs, false for others
8. Return structured JSON array
